> ### About this episode
> In this session we will work in pairs/small groups to learn how to work in a collaborative manner in repositories which belong to a group that you are part of.
> We will do this through a change proposal and review and discuss the pros and cons with different strategies.

> ## Recap <!-- is this needed? does it make sense? -->
>
> Different methods to "download" a repository
>
> - There is no need to download each file one by one.
> - You can either download the repository as ZIP file (green button "Clone or download") if you do not plan to change files
>   and if you are sure that you don't need to browse the history of file changes.
> - **Possibly better: you clone the repository** (green button on the web or through GitHub Desktop or using command line) so that you
>   can apply and track changes and possibly share them later.
> - Cloning copies not only the latest version but all snapshots and all branches and tags: entire history.

## Step 1: Learn how to add collaborators to your repository

Now we know how to work with our own local and remote repositories and the first step to allow changes byothers would be to add your group members or collaborators as "collaborators"
under GitHub. By default this allows them to change things directly (this can be prevented by altering the settings of your repository). In the exercises we'll
make use of change propasals via pull requests and reviews.

<!-- 
- Instructor adds one or two learners who volunteer to later contribute a change via screen sharing.
- You can try this with one of the repositories which we created in the earlier episodes.
-->

- Click on "Settings" (top right), then "Collaborators" (left), then "Add people" (green button).
- Add the collaborator's GitHub username (shared on the post-it in person)

![invite-collaborators](../fig/contributing/invite-collaborators.png)

From here on the collaborators can push changes in the same way as we have done in a
single-person repository in the previous episodes.

## Step 2: Submit a small change via the web interface as collaborator

In the last episodes we learned how to directly commit changes either via web
or via the desktop and you need to be a collaborator (have write permissions)
to be able to do that.

In this exercise we will not change the `main` branch directly but
we will submit a "pull request" (a **change proposal**) towards the `main` branch
for **code review**.

**Exercise**: We will practice this by suggesting a change in a data file:

- Navigate to the repository of your collaborator <!-- add instructions on how here>
- Choose the file `samples_openrefine_lesson.csv` via web (click on the edit pen)
- Modify or extend one row in the data file, <!-- add suggestion on how here>
- Click on commit but instead of choosing "commit directly to `main`" choose "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."  <!-- verify this step>
- Choose a meaningful branch name (it can be useful to prefix it with your name so that we know who this branch belongs to)

![propose-file-change](../fig/contributing/propose-file-change.png)

- After we click "Propose changes" we are taken to this form:
![pull-request-form](../fig/contributing/pull-request-form.png)

- verify the **source and target branch**, verify the **file changes**, if desired: edit the **title** and **description** of the "pull request" (change proposal)
- Click <!-- add instructions on how here>

## Step 3: Review the pull request
Once the "pull request" is submitted, it can be reviewed by a crepository member
- Click on pull request in the top menu
- Review changes
- Write comments
- Approve We can discuss and ask for changes before merging the changes "Merge pull request"
<!-- there are no instruction on review, could that be some extra material at least? -->

> ## Discussion
>
> - Ideally submitter and reviewer should be two different persons.
>   When is this best? When not?
> - You can modify an open "pull request" by committing new changes to the branch
> - Review is not only to assure quality but also to enhance learning and **knowledge transfer** within the group

> - Protecting the `main` branch "forces" all changes to it to be reviewed first.

## Step 4: Resolving a conflict

```{instructor-note}
- "Non-talking instructor" prepares a conflicting commit during session (check
  what the first PR does).
- Conflict can be shown as demo.
```

### Exercise/demo: let us experience a conflict

**When merging** two branches a conflict can arise when the same file **portion**
has been modified in two **different** ways on the two branches.

We can practice how a conflict looks and how to resolve it:
- Two participants should send two "pull requests" (change proposals)
  branching from `main` changing the same line in two different ways

![conflict-edit-1](../fig/contributing/conflict-edit-1.png)
![conflict-edit-2](../fig/contributing/conflict-edit-2.png)

- We merge together one of the pull requests (this will work)
- Then we try to merge the other and we see a conflict:

![conflict-pull-request](../fig/contributing/conflict-pull-request.png)

- We will try to resolve the conflict via web. Hence open the browser.
- Choose the version that you wish to keep, by removing the rows to be discarded as well as conflict markers, click on **Mark as resolved** and then on **Commit the merge**

![conflict-resolution](../fig/contributing/conflict-resolution.png)

> ## Discussion
>
> - Compare with Google Docs: can you get conflicts there? What are the advantages and disadvantages?
> - What can we do to avoid conflicts?

## (Optional) Step 5: Submit a small change via the web interface as external contributor *Optional <!-- update instructions on how to do this for the demo-repository here>

Submitting a change proposal as external contributor (we assume you are not added
as "collaborator" and thus have no write-permissions to a repository) looks very similar
to submitting a "pull request" to a repository with a protected `main` branch.
Only this time you have no other choice than "Propose file change".

Let's try this with one participant who has not been added as collaborator
sharing screen:
- Edit a file with the "pen" button
- Edit the commit message and click green button "Propose file change"
- This creates a **fork** of the repository (GitHub makes a copy of the original repository to your user space)
- You can now still review the change before submitting it, green button "Create pull request"
- Later you can remove the fork if you like

<!-- Summary needs review/refresh -->
> ## Summary
>
> - In this episode we learned how to propose changes and submit changes via "pull requests".
> - Protecting the `main` branch and insisting on every change going
>   through a pull request can be useful to get feedback on your changes
>   and to improve knowledge transfer.
> - For controversial changes it can
>   be useful to first discuss in an issue before submitting the changes.
> - Note that you can mark pull requests as draft to collect feedback on unfinished work.
> - Now that you know how to send improvements, we welcome
>   improvements to [this material](https://github.com/coderefinery/github-without-command-line) also.
