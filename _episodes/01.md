> ### Introduction to the lesson
<!-- revisit when sections are completed, possibly copy text from 2023-04 for intro -->
> This tutorial provides a brief but hands-on introduction to Git and GitHub to exercise useful workflows within GitHub.  Git is a version control system which allows files and data to be tracked synchronized, which allows collaboration and reproducibility. GitHub is a popular website that stores these repositories.
>
> **This tutorial avoids using the command line.** Instead, we will practice collaborating and sharing using either the GitHub website or GitHub desktop application. Why? Because for many cases, it is enough. Especially if you are contributing to existing non-code projects, this may be the fastest, easiest way to do it. Git and GitHub provide collaboration tools to all kinds of projects, and there are all kinds of good ways to use it.
>
> This serves as an introduction to Git. After this lesson, you will both be able to use Git, and feel much more confident taking a command-line Git course such as [CodeRefinery’s git-intro course](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).
>
> What we will not cover
> * Command line interface
> * Cloning using SSH protocol and SSH keys
> * Rebasing and squashing
> * Many Git tricks which can be explored later

> ## Why GitHub?
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
>
> We also encourage course participants to use CodeRefinery’s [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
> for more information see [https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).

## Introduction to Version Control
When making **changes** to files and their content, we risk losing previous content or entire files by overwriting them, hoping they will not be needed. 

Additionally, there may be unintended side effects, such as breaking analysis pipelines when **renaming** files. It can also be challenging to manage multiple changes across different files as a cohesive unit, such as updating a figure and its accompanying description. 

Furthermore, when **collaborating** with others, it is necessary to coordinate and resolve conflicts arising from concurrent changes made by collaborators.

Addressing these issues by tracking changes is called **version control**.

<!-- 
- Version control is a tool that can **record snapshots of a project**.
- You can think of version control like regularly taking a photo of your work
  (movie sets take regular polaroids to be able to recreate a scene the next day).

### When use Version Control?

Basically all work you do where tracking changes is useful:
- Software (this is how it started but Git/GitHub can track a lot more)
- Scripts
- Documents (plain text file much more suitable than Word documents)
- Manuscripts (Git is great for collaborating/sharing LaTeX manuscripts)
- Configuration files
- Website sources
- Data

> ### How Version Control Systems Work
> 
> Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to files and documents over time. 
> They work by keeping track of different versions of a file, allowing users to switch between different versions and merge changes made by multiple users.
> 
> 1. VCS maintain a repository that stores all versions of files, along with metadata such as the author, timestamp, and a unique identifier for each version.
> 2. When a user makes changes to a file, the VCS creates a new version, rather than overwriting the existing one. 
> This preserves the history of changes made to the file.
> 3. VCS provide features like branching and merging, which allow users to create separate lines of development (branches) for different tasks or features, 
> and then merge them back into the main branch when they are ready.
> 4. VCS also enable users to compare different versions of a file, track changes made by different users, and revert to previous versions if needed.
> 5. VCS facilitate collaboration among multiple users by providing mechanisms for resolving conflicts that may arise when two or more users make changes to the same file simultaneously.
>
> Overall, VCS provide a systematic and organized approach to managing changes to files, 
> enabling efficient collaboration, and preserving the history of changes made to a project.

### Why are snapshots valuable? Reproducibility!

- We can always go back if we make a mistake.
- We have the means to refer to a well-defined version of a project when sharing, collaborating, and publishing.
- If we discover a problem, we can find out when it was introduced.
-->
### Version Control Systems vs. Manual Versioning

**In research**, it is vital to keep track of changes made to data, documentation and software by you or your collaborators. This allows you to easily reference or retrieve a specific version of the entire project, which promotes reproducibility. This becomes especially important during various stages of the research process, such as leading up to publication, addressing reviewer comments, and providing information to reviewers, editors, and readers. Keeping a record of changes made ensures that the research findings can be validated, collaborated upon, and documented accurately, enhancing the reliability and transparency of the research work.

To highlight some benefits of version control systems over manual version
control:

* Instead of mandating users to create backups of the entire project, version control systems securely stores only the necessary information to **recreate previous versions** of files on demand.

* Instead of depending on users to come up with meaningful names for backup copies, the version control system automatically **timestamps** all saved changes, ensuring efficient tracking and organization of revisions.

* Instead of requiring users to consistently update a changelog, version control systems prompt users to document changes every time a modification is saved. They also keep a 100% **accurate record** of what was *actually* changed, as opposed to what the user *thought* they changed. This can be immensely valuable for troubleshooting and issue resolution when problems crop up later.

* Instead of blindly copying files to remote storage, version control systems perform **conflict checks** to ensure that no one's work will be overwritten. If conflicts are detected, they are identified, making it easier to resolve and merge changes.

## Version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

To put it simply, **Git** is a version control **system** and a program that you install on your computer, like Word, which helps you keep track of changes in files. It acts like a virtual folder called a repository where all changes are stored as snapshots, also known as commits.

On the other hand, **GitHub** is a **web-based** hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for collaborative work, where you can store and manage your Git repositories online. GitHub acts as a remote repository that can communicate with your local Git repository. Just like OneDrive can synchronize Word documents across multiple devices, GitHub can propagate changes made in Git repositories across different computers and provide a centralized location for collaboration and version control in a group setting.

**GitHub Desktop** is an app, which runs locally on your computer, that provides a graphical user interface to Git and GitHub. Using it, you don't have to write commands in order to communicate changes between the remote GitHub repository and your local Git repository. There are other tools that can do this too (e.g. [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).

<!-- **Git**
- Tool that can record and synchronize snapshots.
- Not the only tool that can record snapshots (other popular tools are
[Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)).
- Not only a tool but also a format that can be read by many different tools.

**GitHub**
- Service that provides hosting for Git repositories with a nice web interface.
- Not the only service that provides this (other popular services are
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)).

> ### Glossary for Git & GitHub
> 
> - **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
> - **commit**: Snapshot/version of the project, gets a unique identifier / commit hash (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
> - **branch**: Independent development line, often we call the main development line `main` or `master`.
> - **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a sticky note that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. `phd-printed` or `paper-submitted`).
> - **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
> - **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your
>   copy (fork) stays on GitHub and you can make changes to your copy.

<!-- 
> ## Why using repositories?
>
> - All changes are recorded.
> - We do not have to send changes via email.
> - We can experiment with several ideas which might not work out (using branches).
> - Several people can work on the same project at the same time (using branches).
> - We do not have to wait for others to send us "the latest version" over email.
> - We do not have to merge parallel developments by hand.
> - Group-based access model where shared access is the default, instead of
>   everything fundamentally owned by individuals who manage sharing as-needed:
>   with Git you can easily have collaboration be the default.
> - It is possible to serve websites directly from a repository.

<!-- Write a quiz with qustions and answer options, concerning the material above -->
> ## Excersice 1: Quiz
> Which of the following statements are correct concerning version control?
>  1. Version control serves as a backup system.
>  1. Version control systems makes it easier to collaborate when working with the same file.
>  1. Using a version control system, I don't have to wonder which version of the manuscript was sent to publisher.  
>  1. ...
>  1. GitHub Desktop is a version control system.
>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> 1. No, version control keeps track of different versions, but your work still needs to be backed up. Relying on only the remote repository at GitHub, does not comply with the 3-2-1 backup rule of having at least 3 copies, on 2 different types of digital media, and at least 1 separate location.
>> 1. Yes, collaborations, and resolution of conflicts when editing the same file, is much easier with a version control system.
>> 1. Well no, all versions are safely kept, but unless you put a (name) tag on a specific version, the system will not be able to help you on wich version was sent to publisher.
>> 1. ...
>> 1. No, GitHub Desktop is an app that provides a graphical user interface to the version control system Git, by communicating with the web service GitHub.
